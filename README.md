Technical Challenge – Internships at Workhuman

Technical Challenge:
Create a small web application using your own choice of Frontend and
Backend technologies.
This application should display a list of countries, including a text input
field for searching. You should be able to provide a string in this input
field, run a search on the list of countries, and return those which match
your input. For example, searching for "eden" should return "Sweden" in
the new list, and searching "united" should return "United States of
America" & "United Kingdom" in the new list. The search functionality
should be case insensitive (e.g "ireland" should return "Ireland" in the
new list).
Your application Frontend and Backend must interact, in a typical
Request-Response model.
The list of countries is provided below - and should be stored in some
persistent layer that the Backend can access (e.g SQLite database,
some appropriate data structure, etc.).
On the day of the interview, we will ask you to do the following:
• Run the application locally, showcasing its functionality and your
implementation.
• Explain some of the technical choices you made (choice of
Frontend/Backend technologies, how you persisted list of
countries and why, etc.)
• Discuss some potential areas of improvement (design,
performance, etc.)
There is no limitation on the use of Google, Stack Overflow, etc. to
research and develop this application.
